# License-Metric (Smart Driver Evaluation System)

An AI-enabled device that assesses driving performance in real-time using accelerometer and gyroscopic data. Built on the STEVAL-MKBOXPRO microcontroller, it provides objective feedback to drivers, aiding in skill improvement and promoting road safety.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks acceleration and angular velocity to detect driving behaviors.

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes a Binary Decision Tree model trained on real-world data to evaluate driving performance.

- **User Feedback:** Offers immediate, data-driven insights to help drivers identify areas for improvement.

- **Wireless Connectivity:** Supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for seamless integration with the ST-BLE mobile app and ST AIOT craft website.

- **Robust Design:** Encased in a custom laser-cut enclosure for durability and easy installation in vehicles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **STEVAL-MKBOXPRO Board:** Ensure you have the STEVAL-MKBOXPRO microcontroller board.

- **Mobile Device:** A smartphone or tablet with the ST AIOT CRAFT app installed.

- **Internet Access:** For connecting to the ST AIOT craft website.

### Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**

   - Secure the STEVAL-MKBOXPRO board inside the laser-cut enclosure.

   - Mount the device in your vehicle, ensuring sensors are correctly oriented.

2. **Software Setup:**

   - Download and install the ST-BLE and ST AIOT CRAFT app from your device's app store.

   - Pair the app with the STEVAL-MKBOXPRO via Bluetooth.

   - Access the ST AIOT craft website for additional features and data analysis.

### Usage of STAIOT DEMO

- **Start a Session:** Use the ST-AIOT CRAFT app to initiate a driving session.

- **Monitor Performance:** During the drive, the system analyzes data and provides real-time feedback.

- **Review Results:** After the session, review detailed performance metrics and recommendations on the applications.

## DIFFERENT MODELS FROM ST-AIOT-CRAFT WEBSITE

- **ALPHA MODEL:** It was giving an accuracy of 75.36%...PLEASE REFER TO THE FILE NAMED default_mlc_alpha to access the mlc.jason and header file of this model.
  
- **ALPHA-BETA MODEL:** It was giving an accuracy of 90.83%...PLEASE REFER TO THE FILE NAMED alpha_beta_Final to access the mlc.jason and header file of this model.

- **OTHER MODEL FILES:** They were giving an accuracy between 78% to 85%....Files are there in the github repo, they contain the header and mcl.jason files of each model.


## DIFFERENT Datasets FROM ST-AIOT-CRAFT WEBSITE

-Majorly TWO DATASETS were used named as Alpha_dataset and Alpha_Beta_Dataset respective to the mlc model files.
